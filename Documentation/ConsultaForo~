Hi everybody! I'm new at MySQL and english is not my native language. So I would really appreciate the patience if somebody answers my question:
I have multiple tables, where each table has a foreign key pointing to the same table. In other words all foreign keys converge into that table.
Lets call that table table A.
(Perhaps "pointing" its not the correct verb, sory if that's the case)
The problem is that I don't know how to restrict the insertion and update of new data into table A in way that each tuple has one and only one tuple pointing to it.
For example: I need to avoid two tuples from different tables pointing to the same tuple in table A. And I need to avoid two tuples from the same table pointing to the same tuple in table A.
Perhaps the solution its a trigger before insert and anether trigger before update in table A.
